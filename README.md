## Add a new post

1. Install `distill` via `install.packages("distill")`.
1. Run `distill::create_post()`.
1. Add a setup chunk to your post
    
   ````r
   ```{r setup, include=FALSE}
   knitr::opts_chunk$set(
     echo = TRUE,
     R.options = list(width = 80)
   )
   ```
   ````
1. Write the post and select appropriate categories.
1. Add required packages to DESCRIPTION file via `usethis::use_package(<package>)`.
1. Render the post (`rmarkdown::render(<post>)`.
   The website can be previewed using `rmarkdown::render_site()` and `pkgdown::preview_site()` or (when using RStudio) by clicking on "Build Website" in the "Build" pane.
1. Apply the [mlr-style](https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr3/wiki/Style-Guide#styler-mlr-style) to the post.
1. Check if everything looks good.
1. Open a Pull Request for review (the `docs/` directory needs to be included - this is the directory that is going to be served via gh-pages).
   This includes **all figures** and other auxillary files.
