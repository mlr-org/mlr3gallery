## Machine Learning Use Case: German Credit Data

- The German credit data is a research data set of the University of Hamburg from 1994 donated by Prof. Hans Hoffman.
- Description (and manual download) can be found at the [UCI repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Statlog+%28German+Credit+Data%29).

- Goal is to classify people by their credit risk (**good** or **bad**) using 20 features:


| Feature Name           | Description                                            |

| foreign_worker         | is applicant foreign worker?                           |

### Importing the Data

The dataset we are going to look at is the **german credit** dataset. It comes with the **mlr3** package.
We can load it using the `tsk()` function.

```{r, message=FALSE}
task = tsk("german_credit")
```

Before we use the data, we'll do a thorough investigation of the dataset.

```{r, message=FALSE}
credit = task$data()
```

### Exploring the Data
- We have a look at the data set before we start modeling.
- The `str()` and `summary()` functions gives an overview of features and their type.
- The `skimr` package gives more readable summaries.
- The `DataExplorer` package lets us visualize categorical (`plot_bar()`) and numeric (`plot_histogram()` and `plot_boxplot()`) data, as well as data relationships.
- Basic things to watch out for:
  - Skewed distributions
  - Missing values
  - Empty / rare factor variables

```{r, R.options=list(width = 120)}
skimr::skim(credit)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(mlr3misc)
credit_short = map_dtc(credit, function(x) {
  if (is.factor(x) || is.character(x)) {
    levels(x) = abbreviate(stringr::str_trunc(levels(x), 16), 12)
  }
  x
})
```

<!-- Visible code --> 
```{r, eval = FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.height=7}
p = DataExplorer::plot_bar(credit_short, nrow = 5, ncol = 3)
```

<!-- Invisible code -->
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.height=7}
p = DataExplorer::plot_bar(credit_short, nrow = 5, ncol = 3)
```

```{r, out.width="100%", fig.height=4}
DataExplorer::plot_histogram(credit, nrow = 2, ncol = 3)
DataExplorer::plot_boxplot(credit, by = "credit_risk", nrow = 2, ncol = 3)
```

## Modeling
Considering how we are going to tackle the problem relates closely to what `mlr3` entities we will use.

- What is the problem we are trying to solve?
  - i.e. what **Task** do we use?
  - Binary classification.
  - $\Rightarrow$ We use `TaskClassif`.
- What are appropriate learning algorithms?
  - i.e. what **Learner** do we use?
  - Logistic regression, CART, Random Forest
  - $\Rightarrow$ `lrn("classif.log_reg")`, `lrn("classif.rpart")`, `lrn("classif.ranger")`
- How do we evaluate "good" performance? $\Rightarrow$ Depends on many things! Cost of false positive vs. false negative, legal requirements, ...
  - i.e. what **Measure** do we use?
  - We start with misclassification error (simle!) and will also consider AUC.
  - $\Rightarrow$ `msr("classif.ce")`, `msr("classif.auc")`

### Task Definition

We create a new task from our data in order to show how Tasks are created.

With `TaskClassif$new()`, we can initialize a classification task. 
We need to specify a name for the task, the data we want to use and name of the target variable (here `"credit_risk"`):

```{r}
task = TaskClassif$new("GermanCredit", credit, "credit_risk")
```


### Learner Definition

You need to install and load the `mlr3learners` package to get access to a wide range of learners.
All available `Learner`s can be obtained by:

```{r}
mlr_learners
```

A learner can be initialized with the `lrn` function and the name of the learner (e.g., `lrn("classif.xxx")`). Use `?mlr_learners_xxx` to open the help page of a learner named `xxx`, or use [the internet](https://mlr3learners.mlr-org.com/reference/index.html).

### Model Fitting: Logistic Regression

- The `Learner` for logistic regression uses R's `glm()` function and is provided by the `mlr3learners` package.

```{r}
learner_logreg = lrn("classif.log_reg")
```

- Model fitting is easy, the resulting model is stored in the `$model` slot.

```{r}
learner_logreg$train(task)
```

- Inspecting the model. It is the result returned by `glm()` and can be inspected as such.
  (The output is too much to show it in the post - but you should definitely do it!)

```{r}
# summary(learner_logreg$model)
```

### Model Fitting: Random Forest

- Same procedure as before.
- We let the model store the variable importance (`importance = "permutation"`) 

```{r}
learner_rf = lrn("classif.ranger", importance = "permutation")
learner_rf$train(task)
```

- We can access the importance values using `$importance()`

```{r, R.options=list(width = 120)}
learner_rf$importance()
```

- We convert the importance into a `data.table` so we can plot it

```{r}
importance = as.data.table(learner_rf$importance(), keep.rownames = TRUE)
colnames(importance) = c("Feature", "Importance")
importance

ggplot(importance, aes(x = reorder(Feature, Importance), y = Importance)) +
  geom_col() + coord_flip() + xlab("")
```

## Prediction

- A model, once trained, can be used to predict outcomes from new data.
- We simulate new data by sampling from the credit data. No need to pay close attention what is going on here.

```{r, R.options=list(width = 120)}
# For each variable, we randomly sample 3 values with replacement
newdata = as.data.table(lapply(credit, sample, size = 3, replace = TRUE))
# we need to set the 'class' column to 'NA', otherwise mlr3 thinks this is the
# actual outcome. This is desirable for performance evaluation, but not here.
newdata$credit_risk = NULL
newdata
```

### Predict Classes

- Let's see what the models predict

```{r}
pred_logreg = learner_logreg$predict_newdata(newdata)
pred_rf = learner_rf$predict_newdata(newdata)

pred_logreg
pred_rf
```

- The `predict()` function actually gives a `Prediction` object. It can be converted to a `data.table`, as well as inspected for other things.

```{r}
pred = learner_rf$predict_newdata(newdata)

head(as.data.table(pred))

pred$confusion
```

- The predictions may disagree, but which do we trust most? We should do [Performance Evaluation](#performance-evaluation) and [benchmarks](#performance-comparison-and-benchmarks)!

### Predict Probabilities

- Learners may not only predict a class variable ("response"), but also their degree of "belief" / uncertainty in a given response.
- We achieve this by setting the `$predict_type` slot to `"prob"`.
- Sometimes this needs to be done *before* the learner is trained.
- Alternatively, we can directly create the learner with this option: `lrn("classif.log_reg", predict_type = "prob")`

```{r}
learner_logreg$predict_type = "prob"
```

```{r}
learner_logreg$predict_newdata(newdata)
```

- Sometimes, you need to be careful when interpreting these values as probabilities!

# Performance Evaluation

To measure the performance of a learner on new unseen data, we usually mimic the scenario of unseen data by splitting up the data into training and test set.
The training set is used for training the learner, and the test set is only used for predicting and evaluating the performance of the trained learner.
Many resampling methods (cross-validation, bootstrap) repeat the splitting process in different ways.

- We need to specify the resampling scheme using the `rsmp()` function:

```{r}
resampling = rsmp("holdout", ratio = 2 / 3)
print(resampling)
```

- We use `resample()` to do the resampling calculation:

```{r}
res = resample(task, learner_logreg, resampling)
res
```

- The default score of the measure is included in the `$aggregate()` slot:

```{r}
res$aggregate()
```

- We can easily do differend resampling schemes, e.g. repeated holdout (`"subsampling"`), or cross validation. - Most methods do repeated train/predict cycles on different data subsets and aggregate the result (usually as the `mean()`). Doing this manually would require us to write loops.

```{r}
res_sub = resample(task, learner_logreg, rsmp("subsampling", repeats = 10))
res_sub$aggregate()
```

```{r}
res_cv = resample(task, learner_logreg, rsmp("cv", folds = 10))
res_cv$aggregate()
```

- We can also calculate scores for different measures (e.g., `msr("classif.fpr")` for the false positive rate).

```{r}
# false positive rate
res_cv$aggregate(msr("classif.fpr"))

# false positive rate and false negative
msr_list = list(
  msr("classif.fpr"),
  msr("classif.fnr")
)
res_cv$aggregate(msr_list)
```

- There are a few more resampling methods, and quite a few more measures. List them in

```{r}
mlr_resamplings
```

```{r}
mlr_measures
```

To get help on a resampling method, use `?mlr_resamplings_xxx`, for a measure do `?mlr_measures_xxx`. you can also use the [mlr3 reference](https://mlr3.mlr-org.com/reference/index.html) online.

Some measure, for example `"auc"`, require a "probability" prediction, instead of a response prediction, see [**Probability Prediction**](#probability-prediction).

## Performance Comparison and Benchmarks

- We could compare `Learners` by evaluating `resample()` for each of them manually.
- `benchmark()` automatically performs resampling evaluations for multiple learners and tasks.
- Create fully crossed designs using `benchmark_grid()`: multiple `Learner`s **x** multiple `Task`s **x** multiple `Resampling`s.

```{r}
lrn_list = list(
  lrn("classif.log_reg", predict_type = "prob"),
  lrn("classif.ranger", predict_type = "prob")
)

bm_design = benchmark_grid(task = task, resamplings = rsmp("cv", folds = 10), learners = lrn_list)
```

- Careful, large benchmarks may take a long time! This one should take less than a minute, however.
- In General, we want use *parallelization* to speed things up on multicore machines.
- This does **not work** on rstudio cloud, so only uncomment it locally!

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# future::plan("multiprocess")
```

```{r}
bmr = benchmark(bm_design)
```

- We can compare different measures. We compare misclassification rate and AUC.

```{r}
msr_list = list(msr("classif.ce"), msr("classif.auc"))
performances = bmr$aggregate(msr_list)
performances[, c("learner_id", "classif.ce", "classif.auc")]
```

## Outlook

- How did we do? We can check the [OpenML](https://www.openml.org/t/31) website for performances of other machine learning methods.
  - We see `ranger` is among the top methods
- Things we have not done that should be considered:
  - We have worked with default hyperparameters, but we may want to see if tuning them helps (Day 2)
  - Some preprocessing and feature extraction steps may sometimes be helpful (Day 3)

## Appendix

### R Pro Tips

* What are the arguments of `lrn()`, `tsk()`, etc. again? -> Think about the corresponding dictionary.

```{r}
mlr_learners

mlr_tasks

mlr_measures

mlr_resamplings
```

* What are the arguments of a `$new()` constructor?

```{r}
formals(TaskClassif$public_methods$initialize)
```

* What are the possible slots and functions of an object?

```{r}
# Writing `pred_rf$`, and pressing <TAB> should work.
# Otherwise:
names(pred_rf)

# try names without `()` first
# and see if it is a function
```

* How do I see the help file of an object

```{r}
# The documentation is organized by object classes
class(pred_rf)

# use ?PredictionClassif, ?Prediction etc.
# Try all elements listed in the class
```

| `ranger`       | Provides the `"*.ranger"` `Learner`s. This is an implementation of the powerful "Random Forest" algorithm, which often works very well, even without parameter tuning.                                   |
| `xgboost`      | Provides the `"*.xgboost"` `Learner`s. Gradient boosting is often among the best performing machine learning methods, although it may require parameter tuning.                                          |
| `e1071`        | Provides the `"*.svm"` and `"classif.naive_bayes"` `Learner`s. SVMs (support vector machines) perform well, but are very dependent on correctly chosen kernel parameters.                                |
