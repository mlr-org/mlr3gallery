# Scope

This is the fourth part of the practical tuning series.
The other parts can be found here:

* [Part I - Tune a Support Vector Machine](https://mlr3gallery.mlr-org.com/posts/2021-03-09-practical-tuning-series-tune-a-support-vector-machine/)
* [Part II - Tune a Preprocessing Pipeline](https://mlr3gallery.mlr-org.com/posts/2021-03-10-practical-tuning-series-tune-a-preprocessing-pipeline/)
* [Part III - Build an Automated Machine Learning System](https://mlr3gallery.mlr-org.com/posts/2021-03-11-practical-tuning-series-build-an-automated-machine-learning-system/)

In this post, we teach how to run various jobs in `r mlr_pkg("mlr3")` in parallel.
The goal is to map *computational jobs* (e.g. evaluation of one configuration) to a pool of *workers* (usually physical CPU cores, sometimes remote computational nodes) to reduce the run time needed for tuning.

# Prerequisites

We load the `r mlr_pkg("mlr3verse")`  package which pulls in the most important packages for this example.
Additionally, make sure you have installed the packages `r cran_pkg("future")` and `r cran_pkg("future.apply")`.

```{r practical-tuning-series-tuning-and-parallel-processing-002, message = FALSE}
library(mlr3verse)
```

We decrease the verbosity of the logger to keep the output clearly represented.
The [`lgr`](https://mlr3book.mlr-org.com/logging.html) package is used for logging in all `r mlr_pkg("mlr3")` packages.
The `r mlr_pkg("mlr3")` logger prints the logging messages from the base package, whereas the `r mlr_pkg("bbotk")`  logger is responsible for logging messages from the optimization packages (e.g. `r mlr_pkg("mlr3tuning")` ).

```{r practical-tuning-series-tuning-and-parallel-processing-003}
set.seed(7832)
lgr::get_logger("mlr3")$set_threshold("warn")
lgr::get_logger("bbotk")$set_threshold("warn")
```

# Parallel Backend

The workers are specified by the parallel backend which orchestrates starting up, shutting down, and communication with the workers.
On a single machine, `multisession` and `multicore` are common backends.
The `multisession` backend spawns new background R processes. It is available on all platforms.

```{r practical-tuning-series-tuning-and-parallel-processing-004}
future::plan("multisession")
```

The `multicore` backend uses forked R processes which allows the workers to access R objects in a shared memory.
This reduces the overhead since R objects are only copied in memory if they are modified.
Unfortunately, forking processes is not supported on Windows and when running R from within RStudio.

```{r practical-tuning-series-tuning-and-parallel-processing-005, eval = FALSE}
future::plan("multicore")
```

Both backends support the `workers` argument that specifies the number of used cores.

Use this code if your code should run with the `multicore` backend when possible.

```{r practical-tuning-series-tuning-and-parallel-processing-006, eval=FALSE}
if (future::supportsMulticore()) {
  future::plan(future::multicore)
} else {
  future::plan(future::multisession)
}
```

# Resampling

The `r ref("resample()")` and `r ref("benchmark()")` functions in `r mlr_pkg("mlr3")` can be executed in parallel.
The parallelization is triggered by simply declaring a plan via `r ref("future::plan()")`.

```{r practical-tuning-series-tuning-and-parallel-processing-007}
future::plan("multisession")

task = tsk("pima")
learner = lrn("classif.rpart") # classification tree
resampling = rsmp("cv", folds = 3)

resample(task, learner, resampling)
```

The 3-fold cross-validation gives us 3 jobs since each resampling iteration is executed in parallel.

The `r ref("benchmark()")` function  accepts  a design of experiments as input where each experiment is defined as a combination of a task, a learner, and a resampling strategy.
For each experiment, resampling is performed.
The nested loop over experiments and resampling iterations is flattened so that all resampling iterations of all experiments can be executed in parallel.

```{r practical-tuning-series-tuning-and-parallel-processing-008}
future::plan("multisession")

tasks = list(tsk("pima"), tsk("iris"))
learner = lrn("classif.rpart")
resampling = rsmp("cv", folds = 3)

grid = benchmark_grid(tasks, learner, resampling)

benchmark(grid)
```

The 2 experiments and the 3-fold cross-validation result in 6 jobs which are executed in parallel.

# Tuning

The `r mlr_pkg("mlr3tuning")` package internally calls `r ref("benchmark()")` during tuning.
If the tuner is capable of suggesting multiple configurations per iteration (such as random search,  grid search,  or hyperband), these configurations  represent  individual  experiments,  and  the  loop  flattening of `r ref("benchmark()")` is triggered.
E.g., all resampling iterations of all hyperparameter configurations on a grid can be executed in parallel.

```{r practical-tuning-series-tuning-and-parallel-processing-009}
future::plan("multisession")

learner = lrn("classif.rpart")
learner$param_set$values$cp = to_tune(0.001, 0.1)
learner$param_set$values$minsplit = to_tune(1, 10)

instance = tune(
  method = "random_search",
  task = tsk("pima"),
  learner = learner,
  resampling = rsmp("cv", folds = 3),
  measure = msr("classif.ce"),
  term_evals = 10,
  batch_size = 5 # random search suggests 5 configurations per batch
)
```

The batch size of 5 and the 3-fold cross-validation gives us 15 jobs.
This is done twice because of the limit of 10 evaluations in total.

# Nested Resampling

Nested resampling results in two nested resampling loops.
For this, an `r ref("AutoTuner")` is passed to `r ref("resample()")` or `r ref("benchmark()")`.
We can choose different parallelization backends for the inner and outer resampling loop, respectively.
We just have to pass a list of backends.

```{r practical-tuning-series-tuning-and-parallel-processing-010}
# Runs the outer loop in parallel and the inner loop sequentially
future::plan(list("multisession", "sequential"))

# Runs the outer loop sequentially and the inner loop in parallel
future::plan(list("sequential", "multisession"))

learner = lrn("classif.rpart")
learner$param_set$values$cp = to_tune(0.001, 0.1)
learner$param_set$values$minsplit = to_tune(1, 10)

rr = tune_nested(
  method = "random_search",
  task = tsk("pima"),
  learner = learner,
  inner_resampling = rsmp ("cv", folds = 3),
  outer_resampling = rsmp("cv", folds = 3),
  measure = msr("classif.ce"),
  term_evals = 10,
  batch_size = 5
)
```

While nesting real parallelization backends is often unintended and causes unnecessary overhead, it is useful in some distributed computing setups. It can be achieved with future by forcing a fixed number of workers for each loop.

```{r practical-tuning-series-tuning-and-parallel-processing-011}
# Runs both loops in parallel
future::plan(list(future::tweak("multisession", workers = 2),
                  future::tweak("multisession", workers = 4)))
```

This example would run on 8 cores (`= 2 * 4`) on the local machine.
