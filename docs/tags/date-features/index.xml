      <description>In this tutorial, we demonstrate how mlr3pipelines can be used to easily engineer features based on date-time variables. Relying on the Bike Sharing Dataset and the ranger learner we compare the RMSE of a random forest using the original features (baseline), to the RMSE of a random forest using newly engineered features on top of the original ones.
Motivation A single Date-Time variable (i.e., a POSIXct column) contains plenty of information ranging from year, month, day, hour, minute and second to other features such as week of the year, or day of the week.</description>
