      <description>Intro First of all we are going to load required packages and the data. The data is part of the mlr3data package.
library(&amp;quot;mlr3&amp;quot;) library(&amp;quot;mlr3learners&amp;quot;) library(&amp;quot;mlr3pipelines&amp;quot;) library(&amp;quot;mlr3data&amp;quot;) library(&amp;quot;mlr3misc&amp;quot;) data(&amp;quot;titanic&amp;quot;) The titanic data is very interesting to analyze, even though it is part of many tutorials and showcases. This is because it requires many steps often required in real-world applications of machine learning techniques, such as feature engineering, missing value imputation, handling factors and others.</description>

      <title>mlr3 basics - german credit</title>

      <description>Intro This is the first part in a serial of tutorials. The other parts of this series can be found here: * Part II * Part III
mlr3 is a machine learning framework for R. Together with other packages from the same developers, mostly following the naming scheme “mlr3___“, it offers functionality around developing, tuning, and evaluating machine learning workflows.
We will walk through this tutorial interactively. The text is kept short to be followed in real time.</description>

      <title>Encode factor levels for xgboost</title>

      <guid>/encode-factors-for-xgboost/</guid>
      <description>The package xgboost unfortunately does not support handling of categorical features. Therefore it is required to manually convert factor columns to numerical dummy features. We show how to use mlr3pipelines to augment the xgboost learner with an automatic factor encoding.
Construct the Base Objects First, we take an example task with factors (german_credit) and create the xgboost learner:
library(mlr3) library(mlr3learners) task = tsk(&amp;quot;german_credit&amp;quot;) print(task) ## &amp;lt;TaskClassif:german_credit&amp;gt; (1000 x 21) ## * Target: credit_risk ## * Properties: twoclass ## * Features (20): ## - fct (12): credit_history, foreign_worker, housing, job, ## other_debtors, other_installment_plans, personal_status_sex, ## property, purpose, savings, status, telephone ## - dbl (7): age, amount, duration, installment_rate, number_credits, ## people_liable, present_residence ## - ord (1): employment_duration learner = lrn(&amp;quot;classif.</description>

      <description>Prerequisites This tutorial assumes familiarity with the basics of mlr3pipelines. Consult the mlr3book if some aspects are not fully understandable. It deals with the problem of missing data.
The random forest implementation in the package ranger unfortunately does not support missing values. Therefore it is required to impute missing features before passing the data to the learner.
We show how to use mlr3pipelines to augment the ranger learner with automatic imputation.</description>
