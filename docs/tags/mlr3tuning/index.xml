      <description>This use case shows how to tune over multiple learners for a single task. Following tasks are illustrated:
 Build a pipeline that can switch between multiple learners. Define the hyperparameter search space for the pipeline. Define transformations for single hyperparameters. Define a hierarchical order of the hyperparameters. Run a random search.  Build the Pipeline The pipeline just has a single purpose in this example: It should allow us to switch between different learners.</description>

      <description>The use-case illustrated below touches on the following concepts:
 Data preprocessing Task Fitting a learner Resampling Tuning  The relevant sections in the mlr3book are linked to for the readerâ€™s convenience.
This use case shows how to model housing price data in King County. Following features are illustrated:
 Summarizing the data set Converting data to treat it as a numeric feature/factor Generating new variables Splitting data into train and test data sets Computing a first model (decision tree) Building many trees (random forest) Visualizing price data across different region Optimizing the baseline by implementing a tuner Engineering features Creating a sparser model  House Price Prediction in King County We use the kc_housing dataset contained in the package mlr3book in order to provide a use-case for the application of mlr3 on real-world data.</description>
