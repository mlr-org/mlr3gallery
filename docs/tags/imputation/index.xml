      <description>Intro First of all we are going to load required packages and the data. The data is part of the mlr3data package.
library(&amp;quot;mlr3&amp;quot;) library(&amp;quot;mlr3learners&amp;quot;) library(&amp;quot;mlr3pipelines&amp;quot;) library(&amp;quot;mlr3data&amp;quot;) library(&amp;quot;mlr3misc&amp;quot;) data(&amp;quot;titanic&amp;quot;) The titanic data is very interesting to analyze, even though it is part of many tutorials and showcases. This is because it requires many steps often required in real-world applications of machine learning techniques, such as feature engineering, missing value imputation, handling factors and others.</description>

      <description>Intro This is the second part in a serial of tutorials. The other parts of this series can be found here: * Part I * Part III
In this tutorial we will continue working with the German Credit Dataset. We already used different Learners on it and tried to optimize their hyperparameters. Now we will
 preprocess the data as an integrated step of the model fitting process tune the preprocessing parameters use multiple Learners in an ensemble model see some techniques that make Learners able to tackle challenging datasets that they could not handle otherwise.</description>

      <description>Intro This is the third part in a serial of tutorials. The other parts of this series can be found here: * Part I * Part II
In this case we will continue working with the German Credit Dataset. Yesterday we peeked into the data set by using and comparing some learners with ther default parameters. We will now see how to:
 Tune hyperparameters for a given problem Perform nested resampling Adjust decision thresholds   Prerequisites We expect you have installed all packages from day 1.</description>

      <title>Impute missing variables</title>

      <description>Prerequisites This tutorial assumes familiarity with the basics of mlr3pipelines. Consult the mlr3book if some aspects are not fully understandable. It deals with the problem of missing data.
The random forest implementation in the package ranger unfortunately does not support missing values. Therefore it is required to impute missing features before passing the data to the learner.
We show how to use mlr3pipelines to augment the ranger learner with automatic imputation.</description>
