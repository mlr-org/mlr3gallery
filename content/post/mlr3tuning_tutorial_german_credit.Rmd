## Intro

This is the third part in a serial of tutorials.
The other parts of this series can be found here:

* [Part I - Basics](/basics_german_credit/)
* [Part III - Pipelines](/basics_pipelines_german_credit/)

In this case we will continue working with the **German Credit Dataset**. Yesterday we peeked into the data set by using and comparing some learners with ther default parameters. We will now see how to:

- Tune hyperparameters for a given problem
- Perform nested resampling
- Adjust decision thresholds

## Prerequisites

We expect you have installed all packages from day 1. If not, load the day 1 script and run the **Prerequisites** install chunk.

Load the packages we are going to use:

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library("data.table")
library("mlr3")
library("mlr3learners")
library("mlr3tuning")
library("ggplot2")
```

```{r, include=FALSE}
theme_set(theme_light())
```

We use the same data as in the earlier blog posts.

```{r, message=FALSE}
task = tsk("german_credit")
```

Also, because tuning often takes a long time, we want to make more efficient use of our multicore CPUs. Don't do this on rstudio cloud, however.

```{r, warning=FALSE}
# future::plan("multiprocess")
```

### Evaluation

We evaluate all algorithms using 10-fold cross-validation. We use a *fixed* train-test split, i.e. the same splits for each evaluation. Otherwise, some evaluation could get unusually "hard" splits, which would make comparisons unfair.

```{r}
set.seed(8008135)
cv10_instance = rsmp("cv", folds = 10)
## fix the train-test splits using the $instantiate() method
cv10_instance$instantiate(task)
## have a look at the test set instances per fold
cv10_instance$instance
```

## Simple Parameter Tuning

- Use the `paradox` package for search space definition of the hyperparameters
- Use the `mlr3tuning` package for tuning the hyperparameters

```{r}
library("mlr3tuning")
library("paradox")
```

### Search Space and Problem Definition

- First need to decide what `Learner` to optimize. We will use `"classif.kknn"`, the "kernelized" k-nearest neighbor classifier.
  <!-- - (We could also try to optimize multiple `Learner`s simultaneously, i.e. choose the `Learner` to use automatically. Look into mlr3pipelines if you want to do that. -->
- We will use `kknn` as a normal kNN without weighting first (i.e., use the `rectangular` kernel):

```{r}
knn = lrn("classif.kknn", predict_type = "prob")
## use rectangular kernel for normal kNN
knn$param_set$values$kernel = "rectangular"
```

- Then we decide what parameters we optimize over. What are our options?

```{r}
knn$param_set
```

- We first tune the `k` parameter from 3 to 20 and the `distance` function (either L1 or L2). To do so, we use the `paradox` package to define a search space (see [Appendix](#very-quick-paradox-primer) for a short list of possible parameter types).

```{r}
searchspace = ParamSet$new(list(
  ParamInt$new("k", lower = 3, upper = 20),
  ParamInt$new("distance", lower = 1, upper = 2)
))
```

- We define a "tuning instance" that represents the problem we are trying to optimize.
  - What is the task we are optimizing for?
  - What learner are we using?
  - How do we do resampling?
  - What is the performance measure?
  - What is the search space ("parameter set")?
  - When are we done searching? (Disregard this for now).

```{r}
instance_grid = TuningInstance$new(
  task = task,
  learner = knn,
  resampling = cv10_instance,
  measures = msr("classif.ce"),
  param_set = searchspace,
  terminator = term("none")
)
```

### Grid Search

- A simple tuning method is to try all possible combinations of parameters: **Grid Search**
  - Pro: Very intuitive and simple
  - Con: Inefficient if the search space is large
- We get the `"grid_search"` tuner for this

```{r}
set.seed(1)
tuner_grid = tnr("grid_search", resolution = 18, batch_size = 36)
```

- Tuning works by calling `$tune()`. Note that it *modifies* our "tuning instance"--the result can be found in the `instance` object.

```{r}
## empty instance object:
instance_grid$result
## now run tuning:
tuner_grid$tune(instance_grid)
```

- The result can be found in the `$result` slot. We can also plot the performance.

```{r}
instance_grid$result
```

- We can look at the "archive" of evaluated configurations
- We expand the "params" (the parameters that the `Learner` actually saw)

```{r}
perfdata = instance_grid$archive("params")
perfdata[, c("nr", "k", "distance", "classif.ce")]
```

```{r}
ggplot(perfdata, aes(x = k, y = classif.ce, color = as.factor(distance))) +
  geom_line() + geom_point(size = 3)
```

- Euclidean distance (`distance` = 2) seems to work better, but there is much randomness introduced by the resampling instance, so you may see a different result!
- `k` between 10 and 15 perform well

### Random Search and Transformation

- Let's look at a larger search space. In fact, how about we tune *all* available parameters and limit `k` to large values (50).
- **Problem 1**: The difference in performance between `k` = 3 and `k` = 4 is probably larger than the difference between `k` = 49 and `k` = 50.
  - We will use a **transformation function** for `k` and sample values on the log-space. 
  - To do so, we define the range for `k` from `log(3)` to `log(50)` and exponentiate in the transformation. 
  - For `k`, we must use `ParamDbl` instead of `ParamInt` now!

```{r}
large_searchspace = ParamSet$new(list(
  ParamDbl$new("k", lower = log(3), upper = log(50)),
  ParamDbl$new("distance", lower = 1, upper = 3),
  ParamFct$new("kernel", c("rectangular", "gaussian", "rank", "optimal")),
  ParamLgl$new("scale")
))

large_searchspace$trafo = function(x, param_set) {
  x$k = round(exp(x$k))
  x
}
```

- **Problem 2**: Using grid search will take a long time.
  - Even trying out three different values for `k`, `distance`, `kernel`, and the two values for `scale` will take 54 evaluations.
  - We use a different search algorithm: **Random Search**
  - The *tuning instance* must now contain a *termination criterion*: When do we stop?

```{r}
tuner_random = tnr("random_search", batch_size = 36)

instance_random = TuningInstance$new(
  task = task,
  learner = knn,
  resampling = cv10_instance,
  measures = msr("classif.ce"),
  param_set = large_searchspace,
  terminator = term("evals", n_evals = 36)
)
```

```{r}
tuner_random$tune(instance_random)
instance_random$result
```

- We can get the "archive" in two ways: expand the `"tune_x"` parameters (the points we sampled on the search space, before transformation):

```{r}
perfdata = instance_random$archive("tune_x")
perfdata[, c("k", "distance", "kernel", "scale", "classif.ce")]
```

- Or look at the `"params"` parameters (the points the `Learner` was used with---these are the `exp()`'d parameters, after transformation of the sampled points):

```{r}
perfdata = instance_random$archive("params")
perfdata[, c("k", "distance", "kernel", "scale", "classif.ce")]
```

Let's look at some plots of performance by parameter.
- The following suggests that `scale` has a strong influence on performance.

```{r}
ggplot(perfdata, aes(x = k, y = classif.ce, color = scale)) +
  geom_point(size = 3) + geom_line()
```

- As for the kernel, there does not seem to be a strong influence:

```{r}
ggplot(perfdata, aes(x = k, y = classif.ce, color = kernel)) +
  geom_point(size = 3) + geom_line()
```


## Nested Resampling
What performance do we expect from our tuned method? Naive evaluation:

```{r}
instance_random$result$perf
instance_grid$result$perf
```

- Problem: *overtuning*:
  - The more we search, the more our result is likely to just be "lucky" on your training data
  - Imagine predicting random values and “tuning” the seed value. If we try enough seeds we may get good (tuning set) performance!
  - Different search spaces or search methods may introduce different amounts of randomness, so even the comparison is flawed!
- Solution: Nested Resampling


The `mlr3tuning` package provides an `AutoTuner` that acts like our tuning method is actually a `Learner`!

- `$train()` method:
  - Tune hyperparameters on the training data, using a resampling strategy (below 5 fold CV).
  - Train a model with optimal hyperparameters on whole training data.
- `$predict()` method: use model trained on the whole training data as model.
- This is just the workflow we use when tuning hyperparameters: Find the best parameters and use them for training.
- The `AutoTuner` does exactly this. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
grid_auto = AutoTuner$new(
  learner = knn,
  resampling = rsmp("cv", folds = 5), # we can NOT use fixed resampling here
  measures = msr("classif.ce"),
  tune_ps = searchspace,
  terminator = term("none"),
  tuner = tnr("grid_search", resolution = 18)
)
```

- The autotuner behaves just like a `Learner`. It can be used to combine the steps of hyperparameter tuning and model fitting, but is especially useful for resampling and fair comparison of performance through benchmarking.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
resample(task, grid_auto, cv10_instance)$aggregate()
```

- Essentially this is the performance of a "knn with optimal hyperparameters found by grid search"

## Appendix

### Example: Tuning With Larger Budget

It is always interesting to look at what could have been. The following dataset contains an optimization run result with 3600 evaluations--more than above by a factor of 100.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
perfdata =readRDS(gzcon(url("https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr-outreach/raw/master/2019_madrid/mlr3tuning/randomsearch_3600.rds")))
```

```{r}
perfdata # obtained from mlr-outreach github repository
```

- The scale effect is just as visible.

```{r}
ggplot(perfdata, aes(x = k, y = classif.ce, color = scale)) +
  geom_point(size = 2, alpha = 0.3)
```

- There seems to be a pattern by kernel as well...

```{r}
ggplot(perfdata, aes(x = k, y = classif.ce, color = kernel)) +
  geom_point(size = 2, alpha = 0.3)
```

- In fact, if we zoom in to `(5, 30)` x `(0.2, 0.3)` and do loess smoothing we see that different kernels have their optimum at different `k`.

```{r, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(perfdata, aes(x = k, y = classif.ce, color = kernel,
  group = interaction(kernel, scale))) +
  geom_point(size = 2, alpha = 0.3) + geom_smooth() +
  xlim(5, 30) + ylim(0.2, 0.3)
```

- What about the `distance` parameter? If we select all results with `k` between 10 and 20 and plot distance and kernel we see an approximate relationship

```{r, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(perfdata[k > 10 & k < 20 & scale == TRUE],
  aes(x = distance, y = classif.ce, color = kernel)) +
  geom_point(size = 2) + geom_smooth()
```

- Observations:
  - The `scale` makes a lot of difference
  - The `distance` seems to make the least difference
  - Had we done grid search, we would have wasted a lot of evaluations on trying different `distance` values that usually give similar results. This is why random search works well.
  - An even more intelligent approach would be to observe that `scale = FALSE` performs badly and not try out so many points with that one.

### Very quick `paradox` primer

Initialization:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ParamSet$new(list( <PARAMETERS> ))
```

Possible parameter types:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
## - logical (values TRUE, FALSE)
ParamLgl$new("parameter_id")
## - factorial (discrete values from a list of 'levels')
ParamFct$new("parameter_id", c("value1", "value2", "value3"))
## - integer (from 'lower' to 'upper' bound)
ParamInt$new("parameter_id", lower = 0, upper = 10)
## - numeric (from 'lower' to 'upper' bound)
## - unfortunately named after the storage type, "double precision floating point"
ParamDbl$new("parameter_id", lower = 0, upper = 10)

## Also possible: "untyped", but we can not tune with this!
ParamUty$new("parameter_id")
```

So an example parameter set with one logical parameter `"flag"` and one integer parameter `"count"`:

```{r}
ParamSet$new(list(
  ParamLgl$new("flag"),
  ParamInt$new("count", lower = 0, upper = 10)
))
```
