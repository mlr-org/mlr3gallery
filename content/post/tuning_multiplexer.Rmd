This use case shows how to tune over multiple learners for a single task.
Following tasks are illustrated:

* Build a pipeline that can switch between multiple learners.
* Define the hyperparameter search space for the pipeline.
  - Define transformations for single hyperparameters.
  - Define a hierarchical order of the hyperparameters.
* Run a random search.


## Build the Pipeline

The pipeline just has a single purpose in this example: It should allow us to switch between different learners.
In the end we will have a so called Piped Learner that uses either an SVM or an random forest (as implemented in the R-package ranger) to train a model, depending on the hyperparameter setting.

First we will define the learners that we are going to use in a named list.
The names are needed to control which learner to use in the pipeline.
They can also be different from the learner id to allow multiple learners with the same id but possible different settings.
We also have to set the `type` hyperparameter of the SVM at this stage already to be able to tune over the `cost` parameter.

```{r}
set.seed(1)
library(mlr3)
library(mlr3tuning)
library(mlr3pipelines)
library(mlr3learners)
library(paradox)
lgr::get_logger("mlr3")$set_threshold("warn")
lgr::get_logger("mlr3tuning")$set_threshold("warn")


learns = list(
  lrn("classif.svm", type = "C-classification"),
  lrn("classif.ranger")
)
names(learns) = mlr3misc::map(learns, "id") # does the same as purrr::map
```

The pipe consists of three elements:
The `branch` operator will pipe the incoming data to one of the following elements depending on how the `branch.selection` parameter is set.
The second element consists of our learners.
Using `lapply(learns, po)` we convert them to single pipe operators.
`gunion` combines them in an unconnected manner, so that they can be used after a branching.
Naturally, one of the learner models has to be the end result of the graph.
`unbranch` takes care of that.

```{r}
pipe =
  po("branch", names(learns)) %>>%
  gunion(unname(lapply(learns, po))) %>>%
  po("unbranch")

pipe$plot()
```

## Define the Search Space

First we want to get a glance of all the hyperparameters we could tune over.
The pipe has a combined parameter set of all learners that is so big, so we have to use a trick to get an overview.

```{r}
as.data.table(pipe$param_set)[,1:4]
```

We decide to tune the `mtry` parameter of the random forest (`ranger`) and the `cost` parameter of the SVM.
Additionally we tune the pipe parameter that chooses whether to use `ranger` or `svm` to build the model.
We have to manually specify the numerical parameters with boundaries.
The categorical parameter of the branch selection can be directly copied.

We know that the `cost` parameter is more sensitive to changes below 1.
To reflect that, we will use a transformation, so that evenly distributed values between -10 and 10 are transformed to values between $2^{-10}$ and $2^{10}$.

Additionally we have to reflect the hierarchical order of the parameter sets.
We can only set the `mtry` value if the pipe is configured to use the random forest (`ranger`).
The same applies to the `cost_trafo` parameter of the SVM.

```{r}
ps = ParamSet$new(list(
  pipe$param_set$params$branch.selection$clone(), # ParamFct can be copied.
  ParamInt$new("classif.ranger.mtry", lower = 1L, upper = 20L),
  ParamDbl$new("classif.svm.cost_trafo", lower = -10, upper = 10)
))

ps$trafo = function(x, param_set) {
  # we only do the trafo if branch.selection == "classif.svm",
  # yes we could also write that in the if statement
  if (!is.null(x$classif.svm.cost_trafo)) {
    x$classif.svm.cost = 2^x$classif.svm.cost_trafo
    x$classif.svm.cost_trafo = NULL
  }
  return(x)
}

ps$add_dep("classif.ranger.mtry", "branch.selection", CondEqual$new("classif.ranger"))
ps$add_dep("classif.svm.cost_trafo", "branch.selection", CondEqual$new("classif.svm"))
```

## Tune the Pipeline with a Random Search

First, we need to build a `Learner` object from the pipe.
Afterwards we can [tune](https://mlr3book.mlr-org.com/tuning.html) it like every other learner.

```{r}
glrn = GraphLearner$new(pipe)
tsk = tsk("sonar")
cv5 = rsmp("cv", folds = 5)
cv5$instantiate(tsk)
# not a must, but ensures that all evals are on the same exact split

instance = TuningInstance$new(
  task = tsk,
  learner = glrn,
  resampling = cv5,
  measures = msr("classif.ce"),
  param_set = ps,
  terminator = term("evals", n_evals = 20)
)

tuner = TunerRandomSearch$new()
tuner$tune(instance)
instance$result
```


The following shows a quick way to visualize the tuning results.

```{r}

# resdf = instance$archive(unnest = "params") #this unnests the transformed values
resdf = instance$archive(unnest = "tune_x") #this unnests the tuner search space values
resdf = tidyr::pivot_longer(
  resdf,
  c("classif.ranger.mtry", "classif.svm.cost_trafo"),
  values_drop_na = TRUE)
library(ggplot2)
g = ggplot(resdf, aes(x = value, y = classif.ce))
g = g + geom_point()
g = g + facet_grid(~name, scales = "free")
g
```

## Possible Errors

In the beginning we had to set `type = "C-classification")` for the learner.
Here is what happens if we forget to do that (some objects are taken from above):

```{r, error = TRUE}
learns2 = list(
  lrn("classif.svm"),
  lrn("classif.ranger")
)
names(learns2) = mlr3misc::map(learns, "id")

pipe2 =
  po("branch", names(learns2)) %>>%
  gunion(unname(lapply(learns2, po))) %>>%
  po("unbranch")

glrn2 = GraphLearner$new(pipe2)

instance2 = TuningInstance$new(
  task = tsk,
  learner = glrn2,
  resampling = cv5,
  measures = msr("classif.ce"),
  param_set = ps, #same param set as above
  terminator = term("evals", n_evals = 20)
)


tuner = TunerRandomSearch$new()
tuner$tune(instance2)
```

So this error tells me that the `type` parameter for the learner is not set but to set the parameter `cost`, `type` has to be set to `"C-classification"`.
The easiest point to do so is before the construction of the pipe.


Another problem that might occur is a wrong definition of the transformation function in the parameter set.

```{r, error = TRUE}
ps3 = ps$clone(deep = TRUE)
ps3$trafo = function(x, param_set) {
  # Wrong! We forgot that classif.svm.cost_trafo is not always present!
  x$classif.svm.cost = 2^x$classif.svm.cost_trafo
  return(x)
}

instance3 = TuningInstance$new(
  task = tsk,
  learner = glrn,
  resampling = cv5,
  measures = msr("classif.ce"),
  param_set = ps3,
  terminator = term("evals", n_evals = 20)
)


tuner = TunerRandomSearch$new()
tuner$tune(instance3)
```
Here the error is less helpful and even a `traceback()` does not hint you directly towards the `trafo` function that is the cause of the error.
If you encounter an error like this it makes sense to use `browser()` inside the `tafo` function or set a breakpoint in RStudio to see how the `x` looks like.
